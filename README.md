## bragArt
A clone of [Simple](https://github.com/orf/simple).

A final project for [silshack Spring 2014](https://github.com/silshack/spring2014), a course in UNC-Chapel Hill's School of Information &amp; Library Science.

### About
bragArt is built on top of Simple--a light weight Flask-based blog app--and designed specifically for use as a personal portfolio. Easy to install, easy to add project information, easy to customize. Out of the box, you get a very vanilla interface based on Bootstrap 3.
